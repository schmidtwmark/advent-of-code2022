> Can you write a shell script for me?

Sure! Here is a simple shell script that prints "Hello, World!" to the console:

```
#!/bin/sh

echo "Hello, World!"
```
To use the script, save it to a file with a .sh extension (for example, hello.sh), make the file executable with the chmod command, and then run it:

```
chmod +x hello.sh
./hello.sh
```

This script uses the echo command to print the "Hello, World!" string to the console. The #!/bin/sh at the top of the script specifies that the script should be run with the sh shell.

I've got a program that I'd like the shell script to run with some options. Here's some examples:
RUST_LOG=info cargo run --bin 10 -- -p 2 -t final
RUST_LOG=debug cargo run --bin 8 -- -p 1 -t 0

Sure, here is a script that can run your program with the specified options:

```
#!/bin/sh

# Set the RUST_LOG environment variable
export RUST_LOG=info

# Run the program with the specified options
cargo run --bin 10 -- -p 2 -t final

# Set the RUST_LOG environment variable
export RUST_LOG=debug

# Run the program with the specified options
cargo run --bin 8 -- -p 1 -t 0
```
This script sets the RUST_LOG environment variable with the export command, and then runs your program with the cargo run command and the specified options.

To use this script, save it to a file with a .sh extension (for example, run_program.sh), make the file executable with the chmod command, and then run it:

```
chmod +x run_program.sh
./run_program.sh
```
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.



>Can you make it so if I run the script with options, it passes those options to the rust program?

Sure, here is a modified version of the script that takes command-line arguments and passes them to the cargo run command:

```
#!/bin/sh

# Set the RUST_LOG environment variable
export RUST_LOG=info

# Get the command-line arguments and pass them to the `cargo run` command
cargo run --bin 10 -- -p 2 -t final $@

# Set the RUST_LOG environment variable
export RUST_LOG=debug

# Get the command-line arguments and pass them to the `cargo run` command
cargo run --bin 8 -- -p 1 -t 0 $@
```
In this script, the $@ notation is used to pass all of the command-line arguments to the cargo run command. This allows you to specify any additional options when running the script, and those options will be passed to the cargo run command.

For example, if you run the script like this:
```
./run_program.sh -o output.txt
```

The -o output.txt arguments will be passed to the cargo run command, and the program will be run with those options.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.



> Can you make a shell script that takes as input 3 parameters: log_level, which defaults to 'info', day number which is required, optional part number and optional input number

Sure, here is a script that takes three parameters as input: log_level, day_number, and part_number:

```
#!/bin/sh

# Set the default log level to 'info'
log_level=${1:-info}

# Set the RUST_LOG environment variable
export RUST_LOG=$log_level

# Get the day number from the command-line arguments
day_number=$2

# Get the part number from the command-line arguments
part_number=${3:-1}

# Get the input number from the command-line arguments
input_number=${4:-0}

# Run the program with the specified options
cargo run --bin $day_number -- -p $part_number -t $input_number
```
This script sets the default value of the log_level variable to info, and then sets the RUST_LOG environment variable to the value of log_level. It then gets the day number, part number, and input number from the command-line arguments and passes them to the cargo run command.

To use this script, save it to a file with a .sh extension (for example, run_program.sh), make the file executable with the chmod command, and then run it:

```
chmod +x run_program.sh
./run_program.sh info 8 1 0
```
This will run the program for day 8, part 1, input 0, and set the log level to info. You can also specify the log level, day number, part number, and input number as command-line arguments when running the script:

```
./run_program.sh debug 8 2 3
```
This will run the program for day 8, part 2, input 3, and set the log level to debug.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.



> Can you make it so part number and input number are optional?

Sure, here is a modified version of the script that makes the part_number and input_number parameters optional:

```
#!/bin/sh

# Set the default log level to 'info'
log_level=${1:-info}

# Set the RUST_LOG environment variable
export RUST_LOG=$log_level

# Get the day number from the command-line arguments
day_number=$2

# Set the default part number to 1
part_number=${3:-1}

# Set the default input number to 0
input_number=${4:-0}

# Run the program with the specified options
cargo run --bin $day_number -- -p $part_number -t $input_number
```

In this script, the part_number and input_number variables are set to default values of 1 and 0, respectively, if they are not provided as command-line arguments. This allows you to run the script without specifying the part_number and input_number arguments if you want to use the default values.

To use this script, save it to a file with a .sh extension (for example, run_program.sh), make the file executable with the chmod command, and then run it:

```
chmod +x run_program.sh
./run_program.sh info 8
```
This will run the program for day 8, part 1, input 0, and set the log level to info. You can also specify the part_number and input_number arguments when running the script:

```
./run_program.sh debug 8 2 3
```
This will run the program for day 8, part 2, input 3, and set the log level to debug.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.



>Can you change the defaults for part and input to the string "all"

Sure, here is a modified version of the script that sets the default values of the part_number and input_number parameters to all:


```
#!/bin/sh

# Set the default log level to 'info'
log_level=${1:-info}

# Set the RUST_LOG environment variable
export RUST_LOG=$log_level

# Get the day number from the command-line arguments
day_number=$2

# Set the default part number to 'all'
part_number=${3:-all}

# Set the default input number to 'all'
input_number=${4:-all}

# Run the program with the specified options
cargo run --bin $day_number -- -p $part_number -t $input_number
```
In this script, the part_number and input_number variables are set to default values of all if they are not provided as command-line arguments. This allows you to run the script without specifying the part_number and input_number arguments if you want to use the default values of all.

To use this script, save it to a file with a .sh extension (for example, run_program.sh), make the file executable with the chmod command, and then run it:

```
chmod +x run_program.sh
./run_program.sh info 8
```
This will run the program for day 8, part all, input all, and set the log level to info. You can also specify the part_number and input_number arguments when running the script:

```
./run_program.sh debug 8 2 3
```
This will run the program for day 8, part 2, input 3, and set the log level to debug.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.



> Can you make part and input named parameters?

Sure, here is a modified version of the script that uses named parameters for the part_number and input_number arguments:

```
#!/bin/sh

# Set the default log level to 'info'
log_level=${1:-info}

# Set the RUST_LOG environment variable
export RUST_LOG=$log_level

# Get the day number from the command-line arguments
day_number=$2

# Set the default part number to 'all'
part_number=${3:-all}

# Set the default input number to 'all'
input_number=${4:-all}

# Parse the command-line arguments
while [ $# -gt 0 ]; do
  case "$1" in
    -p|--part)
      shift
      part_number=$1
      ;;
    -t|--input)
      shift
      input_number=$1
      ;;
  esac
  shift
done

# Run the program with the specified options
cargo run --bin $day_number -- -p $part_number -t $input_number
```
In this script, the part_number and input_number variables are set to default values of all if they are not provided as named arguments. This allows you to run the script without specifying the -p and -t arguments if you want to use the default values of all.

To use this script, save it to a file with a .sh extension (for example, run_program.sh), make the file executable with the chmod command, and then run it:

```
chmod +x run_program.sh
./run_program.sh info 8
```
This will run the program for day 8, part all, input all, and set the log level to info. You can also specify the -p and -t arguments when running the script:

```
./run_program.sh debug 8 -p 2 -t 3
```
This will run the program for day 8, part 2, input 3, and set the log level to debug.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
